1.
 What is the difference between a parallel and serial interface?
 a: serial sends data in sequence one packet at a time, parallel can send multiple packets on different wires and assembly is done on the other side.
2.
 What is the difference between a synchronous and asynchronous interface?
 a: Synchronous is synchronized with the sending device using a shared clock. Asynchronous doesn't provide a sync clock and instead it is expected that both devices are using an internal clock that makes communication possible.
3.
 What is one thing that a communication protocol does?
 a: define how raw bits and bytes are interpreted, what the data rate should be, etc.
4.
 What does the baud rate of a signal mean?
 a: The rate at which data is being sent so that the receiving side can set an internal clock to synchronize.
5.
 What register in the USART would you use to enable the transmitter hardware?
    a: USART CTRL Registers
6.
 Does the transmit (TX) line of the USB-USART cable connect to the transmit (TX) or receive
(RX) of the STM32F0?
    a: RX
